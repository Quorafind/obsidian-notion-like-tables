# Undo and redo

Table changes can be undone or redone using the keyboard.

| Name | Windows      | Mac                   |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Undo | `ctrl` + `z` | `cmd` + `z`           |
| Redo | `ctrl` + `y` | `cmd` + `shift` + `z` |

## Future development

Currently there is no undo/redo support for filter rules
