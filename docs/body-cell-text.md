### Links to Notes

To create a link to a note start by typing two front brackets `[[`. A file suggestion menu will popup by which you can choose a file name.

Links follow the exact syntax as [Obsidian wiki links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links).

**Mac**

-   Hold `shift` and press `return`
