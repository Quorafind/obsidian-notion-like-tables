# Embedding tables

A table may be embedded into a note by using the [embedded file syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files). For example, to embed a table called `Untitled.table` you would use the syntax `![[Untitled.table]]`.

An embedded table will preform the same functions as a normal table, the only limitation being a smaller window.

Changes that are made to an embedded table will be saved to the table file. Changes made to an embedded table will also update any open tabs that contain a Notion-Like table.

## Future development

Currently there is no support for `preview` mode. This is part of the roadmap for future development.
